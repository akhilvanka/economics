\textbf{Hey everybody},

Hope y'all are having a great school year so far, or if you are like me and failing all your classes, that you're doing all right. If you probably are using this note sheet, then you probably take the same class, so you will most likely understand what I will be talking about in a second. WIth the next unit in this note sheet, and even the previous one, the teacher doesn't really teach the topic in a easy to understand way. I think that the concepts and topics are way easier to understand if they are taught differently, so thats what I plan on doing. I will be moving away from using the teachers words and slides as reference, and use them as guidelines. 

Somethings will remain similar between them, but I will be modifying the content, or inclduing more notes in sections to help everyone taking this class. Anyway, just a small update that I doubt anybody will read but Ill include anyway. GL on upcoming exams, and thats everything from me.
