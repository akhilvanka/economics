\section{\normalfont Opportunity Cost and the PPC}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{Production Possibilities Curve} is an economic model that shows alternative ways that scare resources can be used. The model graphically shows scarcity, trade-offs, and opportunity costs.
\end{definition}
With economic models, there are some assumptions that have to be made for the PPC model to apply,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only \textbf{TWO} goods can be produced
    \item Full employment of resources
    \item Fixed resources
    \item Fixed technology
\end{itemize}

The data can also be displayed in a \textbf{Production Possibilities Table}, where each point represents a specific combination of goods that can be produced given full employment of resources.

\end{figure}

The table demonstrates how much of each good can be produced with full employment of resources. Country X can produce 14 Bikes or 8 Computers if they solely focus on producing said good. If we take the points and plot them, we get a PPC curve.

The PPC can shift, just like any econonmics graph. Make sure you can logically reason through why
